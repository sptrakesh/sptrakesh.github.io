# OpenAPI to LaTeX

I developed this as testbed while familiarising myself with 
[Julia](https://julialang.org/).  A couple of companies I assisted also had a need for 
attaching API specifications with their customer contracts. The result of these needs 
is this project.

The primary rationale for this utility is to be able to generate a PDF document that can 
be distributed to interested parties, when the source specifications are protected by access 
control (and where the said parties do not need to be provided with the access credentials).

The workflow is to use this utility to generate the target LaTeX file, and run `pdflatex`
a few times (usually two times to get cross-references resolved) for the output PDF document.

## Structure
The generated LaTeX file has the following structure (you can of course modify the output 
file as desired):

* **Frontmatter** - Titlepage and table of contents.
* **Mainmatter** - Contains two or three parts.
  * **Info** - The *info* object is presented as the first chapter.
  * **Endpoints** - Part with the path operations grouped by tags. Each tag is presented in 
    a *chapter*.
  * **Schemas** - Part with the *schemas* declared and referenced in the specification. 
    Each *schema* is presented in a *chapter*. Schemas are listed alphabetically by their 
    filename and entity name.
  * **Code Samples** - If the `x-codeSamples` extension exists for operations, these are 
    collected together into a third part. Code samples are grouped together under each 
    tag group, which is presented as a *chapter*.
* **Backmatter** - List of *tables*.

See [vh.pdf](https://github.com/sptrakesh/openapi2latex/blob/master/vh.pdf) for a sample 
PDF generated by this utility.

## Usage
The generator is written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/), and hence requires it to be 
installed on the target computer.

The set of scripts are not packaged as a *Julia Package*, since it is not designed for 
re-use in other systems. The [Project.toml](https://github.com/sptrakesh/openapi2latex/blob/master/Project.toml)
file lists all the dependencies as regular packages would.

## Install Dependencies
Start the Julia Pkg REPL.

## Command Line Options
The following options are supported by the 
[main.jl](https://github.com/sptrakesh/openapi2latex/blob/master/main.jl) script:

* `--input | -i` - **Required**. The main OpenAPI specification file to parse.
* `--output | -o` - **Required**. The output LaTeX file to generate. Best to place this at 
  another location than the api specs.
* `--author | -a` - The author credit to show on the titlepage.
* `--footer | -f` - The right side footer text to display for the document.
* `--operation-summary | -s` - A flag to indicate that **Operation** summary should be used 
  as section headings instead of *operationId*.
* `--debug | -d` - Show debug log messages.

## Extensions
A few extensions to the specifications developed by [Redocly](https://redocly.com/) are supported.

* Source code samples are parsed from the `x-codeSamples` array attached to an operation. 
  All code samples are attached to a separate part of the output document, and follow the 
  same chapter organisation as the API tags.
* Tag groups are parsed from the `x-tagGroups` array attached to the root of the specification 
  document. If specified, an initial chapter **Tag Groups** is added, which lists the groupings 
  with links to the Tag chapters.

## Limitations
Probably too many to list, but the following items should be kept in mind.

* This utility is based on the way *I write API specifications*, and markup descriptions.
* Schema objects are assumed to model closely their organisation in a source code implementation. This in turn implies that nested structures are represented as schema references, and not listed in-line in the schema. Deeply nested in-line schemas would be very hard to represent in a printed document in any case.
* Mainly tested with specifications that are split into individual files - representing 
  paths, schemas, parameters etc. Most testing has been against large handwritten specifications,
  which follows the principles laid out in [split specifications](https://davidgarcia.dev/posts/how-to-split-open-api-spec-into-multiple-files/).
  A few simple single file specifications have also been tested.
* Mainly supports OpenAPI specification version [3.0.3](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3),
  although some properties from [3.1.0](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html) are also 
  included. In particular, schemas are expected in `3.0.3` format.
* Only supports loading local specification files in **YAML** format. **JSON** is not 
  supported at present.
* Not all properties/aspects of the specification are output in the generated LaTeX file. 
  I selected what I felt are most relevant to be shared.
* Markdown markup may not be fully translated to LaTeX. See [runtests.jl](https://github.com/sptrakesh/openapi2latex/blob/master/runtests.jl)
  for basic rules implemented.
  * Bold/italic blocks of text (spanning paragraphs) are not supported.

The output is a LaTeX file, and hence can be easily modified as needed to further 
customise the final PDF document.
