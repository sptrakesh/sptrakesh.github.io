# Video Player

An application very similar in purpose to [Movie Player](Movie-Player.md) built
specifically for Mac OS X.  Developed in [Swift](https://github.com/sptrakesh/VideoPlayer)
using the native *Media Player Framework*.

A couple of minor differences to the original movie player application:
* Loads directories in the background to present a non-blocking UI.
* Opening a directory automatically closes the current directory being played back.
* Rename files in the files table.
